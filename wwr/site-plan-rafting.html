    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p> My purpose for this website is to attract as many potential customers as are needed to keep the business alive.
        We need this website in order for potential customers to see the items they are looking for at a fair price, while also protecting their private data. </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p> My target audience for this website is a strong passionate community for water rafting. 
        We want to attract peoples with all walks of life and will focus on mainly adults from 18-40 years old that enjoy this fun outdoor activity. 
        They are using this website because they want a one stop shop for all their needs, whether that is buying equipment, replacement parts, or tours and or expeditions. 
        They are using this site because all the other water rafting websites 
        are hard to use, outdated, and their prices are extremely high, with poor customer service and relationships. </p>

Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
