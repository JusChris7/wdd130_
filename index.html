    <h2> Justin Christofferson</h2>
    <p> Hello everyone, my name is Justin, I am trying to get my bachelors degree in computer science,
        I am quite grateful to be studying at BYU and for these online programs. I am married and have been for about two and half years.
        I am currently working for a solar panel company while I'm going to school.
        I have been a member of the church my whole life and I am quite grateful to be a member of the church.
        I served a mission in Mexico City, and the photo I upload is at one of my mission friends homecomings.
    </p>
